# Time Based Content

Displays a different front page according to the time of the day.

## Usage

1. Install and activate the plugin in WordPress

2. Ensure you have four pages for this plugin, one for each moment of the day:

   - one for the morning
   - another for noon
   - one more for the afternoon
   - and a last one for the night
     You'll probably want to have a default page to display if the time ranges you specify pages don't cover the entire day

3. Go to the WordPress Reading settings page at WP Admin > Settings > Reading

4. Set Your homepage displays to A static page and select any page you'd like to display whenever you're not displaying one of the specific pages for the times of the day. For example, if you specify that the night page will be displayed until 12:00 am, and the morning page will start displaying at 07:00 am, then this page will display betwen that time when no other page is assigned.

5. Go to the plugin settings page at WP Admin > Settings > Time Based Content

6. Select the time ranges and the page to display at each time.

7. Save the changes.

If you now go to the front end of the site, you'll see the page you specified.
